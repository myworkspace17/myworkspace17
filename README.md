🚀 About the Project: Bank Customer Churn Analysis
In this project, I analyze customer churn data from a bank to identify factors contributing to customer attrition. Using Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization, I aimed to uncover trends, demographic insights, and key drivers of churn. The goal is to help the bank improve retention strategies and reduce churn by addressing its underlying causes.

🔑 Key Insights & Findings
Total Customers and Churn Rate:
Total Customers: 10,000
Churn Rate: 20.4% (2,037 customers) — This is significantly higher than the target churn rate of 15%.
Retention Rate: 79.63% of customers are retained, but the high churn rate indicates a need for urgent attention to customer retention strategies.
Gender Distribution:
Female: 54.57%
Male: 45.43%
The gender distribution is fairly balanced, suggesting that gender is not a significant factor in churn.
Activity Status:
Active: 51.51%
Inactive: 48.49%
Nearly half of the customers are inactive, which represents a high churn risk. Inactive customers are more likely to leave, signaling an urgent need for re-engagement campaigns to retain these users.
Credit Card Ownership:
70.55% of customers own a credit card, while 29.45% do not.
Credit card ownership correlates with higher engagement and loyalty, so addressing the needs of customers without credit cards could significantly help in reducing churn.
Geographical Distribution:
Spain: 24.77%
Germany: 25.09%
France: 50.14%
The highest concentration of customers is in France, presenting an opportunity to implement region-specific strategies to combat churn in this area.
Product Distribution:
Product 1: 50.84%
Product 2: 45.9%
Product 3: 2.66%
Product 4: 0.60%
There is low adoption of Products 3 and 4, suggesting that further investigation is needed to understand why these products are underperforming and whether they contribute to customer churn.
Age Group Analysis:
Highest churn rate: The 51–60 age group with a churn rate of 56.2%.
Lowest churn rate: The Under 20 age group with a churn rate of 5.6%.
The 51–60 age group has a high churn rate, suggesting that this age group may be experiencing issues that lead them to leave. Targeted retention strategies could be implemented to address these issues.
Credit Score Analysis:
Highest churn rate: Customers with credit scores < 400 show a 100% churn rate.
Customers with lower credit scores are at a higher risk of churn, indicating that financial health is a key factor influencing retention. Offering financial education programs or better credit support might help reduce churn in this segment.
Account Balance Analysis:
Most common balance range: Customers with 100k-200k in their accounts (4,765 customers).
Highest churn rate: Customers with account balances between 1k-10k have a 100% churn rate. Customers with a 0 balance have a 13.8% churn rate.
Even high-value customers (over 200k balance) show signs of potential churn, suggesting that even long-term, high-value customers may be seeking better opportunities elsewhere. This indicates the need for better customer engagement and loyalty programs to retain these high-value customers.
🛠️ Tools Used:
Excel: For data cleaning, data transformation, and initial exploratory analysis.
Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards, data visualizations, and deriving insights.
Power Query (Excel): For transforming and preparing the data in Excel.
Data Visualization: Used Power BI to create visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and heat maps to explore churn trends by demographic, product type, and activity status.
📝 Procedure Followed:
Data Cleaning & Transformation:

Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
Standardized product names and customer statuses.
Transformed data for consistency and applied Power Query for easy extraction of insights.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized churn trends by factors like age, gender, credit score, account balance, and product ownership.
Performed statistical analysis to identify key churn drivers and correlations between variables.
Data Visualization & Insights Generation:

Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize churn patterns and key metrics (e.g., churn by age group, churn by geographical location).
Added filters and slicers in Power BI to allow stakeholders to analyze the data from different perspectives.
Generated actionable insights for the bank to focus on customer segments with the highest churn risk, such as customers with low credit scores or inactive accounts.
