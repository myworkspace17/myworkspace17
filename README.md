## 🚀 **About the Project: Bank Customer Churn Analysis**

This project focuses on analyzing **customer churn** in a **banking sector** context to uncover the factors contributing to customer attrition. Using **Power BI** and **Power Query**, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and built an **interactive dashboard** to visualize key insights related to churn. The goal is to help the bank identify high-risk customers, improve retention strategies, and optimize their customer service efforts.

### **Key Tasks**:
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** using **Power Query** in **Power BI**.
- **Data Analysis** to uncover trends and patterns in customer behavior.
- **Dashboard Creation** to visualize churn rate, high-risk segments, and other key insights.
- **Churn Prediction** to identify at-risk customers and help improve retention strategies.

## 🔑 **Key Insights**:

- **Churn Rate**: The **overall churn rate** is **20.4%** (2,037 customers), which is **higher** than the target churn rate of **15%**.
- **Customer Demographics**:
  - **Age**: The **51–60 age group** has the highest churn rate at **56.2%**.
  - **Credit Score**: Customers with **credit scores below 400** show a **100% churn rate**, indicating financial health is a strong factor in retention.
- **Geographical Insights**: The **highest churn rate** is observed in **France**, which has **50.14%** of the customers who left.
- **Product Analysis**: **Products 3 and 4** have **low adoption rates** and seem to contribute less to customer retention.
- **Account Balance**: Customers with **account balances between ₹1k-₹10k** exhibit the highest churn rates, signaling that customers with lower balances are at risk.

## 🛠️ **Tools Used**:
- **Power BI**: For data visualization, dashboard creation, and analysis.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning, transformation, and data wrangling.
- **SQL**: Used for extracting and querying relevant customer data from the database.
- **Excel**: Used for preliminary data analysis and calculations.

## 📝 **Procedure Followed**:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Removed duplicate entries** and handled missing values to ensure data integrity.
   - Standardized column values (e.g., replacing "1" with "Churned" and "0" with "Not Churned").
   
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Used **Power Query** to **merge columns**, change data types, and create calculated columns to help with further analysis.
   
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Analyzed the impact of **demographics**, **account balance**, and **credit score** on churn rates.
   - Calculated churn percentages for different customer segments.
   
4. **Visualization**:
   - Created **interactive dashboards** to visualize key trends such as churn by age group, geography, and product adoption.
   - Built charts to compare churn rates across different customer segments and performance indicators.
